# PlanetBaubles
## Solar system Christmas lights
This code coordinates neopixels from a raspberry pi to illuminate colours representing each planet in the solar system.
It complements these 3D printed parts over on thingiverse: [3D parts](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5172632)

Place a neopixel in each planet/bauble and it will subtly twinkle with the natural colours of that planet. 

## Setup
Enter your coordinates into the code and it will flash the planets when they're overhead.
During the day, the sun will be generally yellow. At night it will have a disco.

For minimal setup, place the files on the desktop of a pi zero and install python dependencies. 
The launch and kill shell scripts can be used to test before setting the code to run at boot.
